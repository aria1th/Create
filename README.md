If you want to help test Create on Fabric, you can use a recent build artifact from [our Actions page](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create/actions).
**These builds may or may not break your world. You use them at your own risk.** If you decide to test
the mod, please be sure to [report any issues](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create/issues)
you find (if they haven't yet been reported)!

Non-testers are invited to listen to [Tchaikovsky's violin concerto in D major](https://youtu.be/cbJZeNlrYKg) while they wait.
<sup>Seriously, it's an awesome piece of music</sup>

Welcome to Create, a mod offering a variety of tools and blocks for Building, Decoration and Aesthetic Automation.

The added elements of tech are designed to leave as many design choices to the player as possible, where item processing doesn't happen inside a single block with funny textures, it requires a set of actors working together in many possible arrangements.

Check out the wiki and in-game Tool-tips for further info on how to use these features, and stay tuned for an ever-growing selection of possibilities for Creative and Survival Minecraft.
